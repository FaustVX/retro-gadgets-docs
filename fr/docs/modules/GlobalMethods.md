# Global Methods
The following is a list of methods that can be called anywhere in your program.

## ~~Assets~~
**❌ These methods have been removed in favor of ROM. Only use these for compatibility purposes.**

### GetSpriteSheet(name `string`) `SpriteSheet`
Provides a SpriteSheet from the MultiTool asset list.

### GetPalette(name `string`) `Palette`
**❌ This method is deprecated.**

**⚠️ The functionality of this method has not yet been tested.**

### GetAudioSample(name `string`) `AudioSample`
Provides an AudioSample from the MuliTool asset list. Supports mp3 and wav.

### GetCode(name `string`) `Code`
Provides a Lua file from the MuliTool asset list, which can be dynamically assigned to a CPU.

## Color

### Color(r `number`, g `number`, b `number`) `color`
Composes and returns a color object out of RGB values. The three parameters should be in the range of 0 - 255.

### ColorRGBA(r `number`, g `number`, b `number`, a `number`) `color`
Composes and returns a color object out of RGB values, along with an alpha channel. The four parameters should be in the range of 0 - 255. For the alpha channel, 0 is completely transparent and 255 is opaque.

### ColorHSV(h `number`, s `number`, v `number`) `color`
Composes and returns a color object out of HSV values. The ranges for the hue should be 0 - 360 and the range for the saturation and value should be  0 - 100.

## Console

### log(message `string`)
Prints a message to the MultiTool console. Unlike Lua's builtin `print` function which accepts all data types, this method requires you to use a single string. To use other data types, use `tostring()`.

### logWarning(message `string`)
Prints yellow text to the MultiTool console indicating some sort of precaution or advisement; a warning.

### logError(message `string`)
Prints red text to the MultiTool console indicating some sort of error or exception. This does not stop the program like other errors.

### write(text `string`)
Prints a message to the MultiTool console without adding a new line. Functions identically to `log()` otherwise.

### writeln(text `string`)
Does the same thing as `write()`, except appends a new line to the end of the text. Functions identically to `log()`.


### setFgColor(colorId `number`)
**⚠️ The functionality of this method has not yet been tested.**

Sets the text color in the MultiTool console.

### setBgColor(colorId `number`)
**⚠️ The functionality of this method has not yet been tested.**

Sets the background color in the MultiTool console.

### resetFgColor()
**⚠️ The functionality of this method has not yet been tested.**

Resets the text color in the MultiTool console.

### resetBgColor()
**⚠️ The functionality of this method has not yet been tested.**

### setCursorY(line `number`)
Sets the cursor's Y position in the MultiTool console. The console can display a maximum of 8 lines before overflowing.

### moveCursorX(deltaColumn `number`)
**⚠️ The functionality of this method has not yet been tested.**

Changes the MultiTool's cursor's X position by `deltaColumn`.

**⚠️ The functionality of this method has not yet been tested.**

Changes the MultiTool's cursor's Y position by `deltaLine`.

### saveCursorPos()
**⚠️ The functionality of this method has not yet been tested.**

Saves the position of the console cursor to memory.

### restoreCursorPos()
**⚠️ The functionality of this method has not yet been tested.**

Restores the cursor position saved by `saveCursorPos()` and sets it to the result.

### clear()
Clears the MultiTool console.

### clearToEndLine()
