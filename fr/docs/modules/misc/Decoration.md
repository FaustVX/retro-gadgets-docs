Decoration is, well, decoration. They're grip-like indentations in your gadget used for aesthetic purposes. There's also a screw.

Decoration components show up in the gadget, but do not have any methods or properties.

```lua
local decor:Decoration = gdt.Decoration0
-- decor.? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```
